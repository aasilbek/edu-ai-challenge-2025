# Sea Battle Game Refactoring Report

## Overview
The Sea Battle game has been refactored to improve code quality, maintainability, and testability. The refactoring focused on modernizing the codebase using ES6+ features, implementing proper object-oriented design, and adding comprehensive unit tests.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Code Modernization
- Converted to ES6+ syntax using classes, arrow functions, and modern JavaScript features
- Replaced `var` with `const` and `let` for better scoping
- Implemented proper module exports for better code organization
- Used template literals for string interpolation
- Utilized array methods like `map`, `fill`, and `every` for cleaner code

### 2. Object-Oriented Design
- Created distinct classes for different game components:
  - `Board`: Manages the game grid and cell states
  - `Ship`: Handles ship properties and hit detection
  - `Player`: Base class for player functionality
  - `CPUPlayer`: Extends Player with AI-specific logic
  - `Game`: Orchestrates the game flow

### 3. Code Organization
- Separated concerns into logical classes
- Removed global variables
- Encapsulated state within classes
- Improved method naming and organization
- Added proper error handling and validation

### 4. Game Logic Improvements
- Enhanced ship placement logic
- Improved CPU AI with better targeting
- Added proper game state management
- Implemented async/await for better flow control
- Added input validation and error handling

### 5. Testing
- Added comprehensive unit tests using Jest
- Test coverage includes:
  - Board creation and manipulation
  - Ship placement and hit detection
  - Player moves and validation
  - CPU AI behavior
  - Game state management

## Recent Fixes and Improvements

### 1. Board Display
- Fixed board display formatting to match original game
- Implemented proper column and row header alignment
- Added ship hiding for opponent's board
- Improved visual spacing and readability

### 2. CPU AI Logic
- Fixed infinite recursion in CPU guess generation
- Improved hunt/target mode switching
- Enhanced targeting strategy
- Added proper guess validation

### 3. Testing Setup
- Added Jest configuration
- Implemented proper test structure
- Added test coverage reporting
- Fixed test cases to match new implementation

## Technical Details

### Class Structure
1. **Board Class**
   - Manages 10x10 grid
   - Handles cell states (empty, ship, hit, miss)
   - Provides validation methods
   - Implements ship hiding for opponent view

2. **Ship Class**
   - Tracks ship locations
   - Manages hit detection
   - Handles ship sinking logic

3. **Player Class**
   - Manages ship placement
   - Handles guess validation
   - Tracks game state

4. **CPUPlayer Class**
   - Implements AI logic
   - Manages hunt/target modes
   - Handles targeting strategy
   - Prevents duplicate guesses

5. **Game Class**
   - Orchestrates game flow
   - Manages player turns
   - Handles game state
   - Provides proper board display

### Testing Coverage
- Unit tests cover all major components
- Test cases verify:
  - Board initialization and manipulation
  - Ship placement and hit detection
  - Player move validation
  - CPU AI behavior
  - Game state management
