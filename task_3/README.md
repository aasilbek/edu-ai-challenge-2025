# [Task 3] - Text Summarization and Sentiment Analysis
EDU AI Challenge
In this task, weâ€™ll practice using chat interface to craft prompts for text summarization and sentiment analysis, mastering techniques to achieve precise outputs without API integration.
 
## Theory
**AI Technique**: Text Summarization; Sentiment Analysis
This task focuses on using **prompting techniques** with the **OpenAI online chat interface** (e.g., ChatGPT) to perform text summarization and sentiment analysis. You will practice crafting effective prompts to achieve specific outputs without the need for API integration. <br>
**Text Summarization**: the process of condensing a large body of text into a shorter version while retaining its essential meaning and key information. This can be achieved via two main approaches:

- **Extractive Summarization**: Selecting and combining key sentences or phrases from the original text.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generating new sentences and paraphrasing the content for conciseness.

**Sentiment Analysis**: a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine the emotional tone of a given piece of text. It identifies whether the sentiment is:

- **Positive**: Reflecting optimism or satisfaction.
- **Neutral**: Lacking strong emotional indicators.
- **Negative**: Reflecting dissatisfaction, criticism, or pessimism.

Sentiment scores are often represented numerically, where:

- **-1** indicates very negative sentiment.
- **0** indicates neutral sentiment.
- **+1** indicates very positive sentiment.

<u> Example 1 </u>
- Text: "I love how easy this app is to use. Great job!"
- Sentiment: Positive
- Score: +1
<u> Example 2 </u>
- Text: "The website keeps crashing every time I try to log in."
-  Sentiment: Negative
- Score: -1
 
## Task
In this task, you are given a raw text input task_3_input.docx. Your goal is to craft a prompt for an AI assistant to perform the following:
Generate a concise summary of the input text.
- Analyze the sentiment and classify it as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.
- Provide a **sentiment score** (e.g., -1 for very negative, 0 for neutral, +1 for very positive).
- Return the results in a **structured JSON format**, including all of the above and any relevant metadata you deem useful.

## Verification
You need to provide **2 files**:
Prompt that you were using to achieve the described requirements(**prompt.txt**).
Result that you got using this prompt(**result.json**).
 
Place your solution files in the appropriate folder of the Challenge project repository on your GitHub account
 
## Requirements
The result that you got using your prompt should align with all the requirements stated in the task description.
