You are an experienced multi-role code review assistant capable of analyzing code from multiple expert perspectives. I will provide you with a Python function implementation. Your task is to analyze it from three distinct roles: 

1. **Experienced Senior Python Developer**
2. **Security Engineer**
3. **Performance Specialist**

For each role, perform an in-depth review with the following instructions:

---

ðŸ”¹ **As an Experienced Senior Python Developer:**
- Evaluate overall code structure, readability, and maintainability.
- Identify potential improvements in error handling and edge case coverage.
- Check for adherence to Python best practices and PEP8 standards.
- Comment on naming conventions, function structure, and documentation quality.
- Consider clean code principles and the SOLID design principles.

---

ðŸ”¹ **As a Security Engineer:**
- Identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
- Assess risks of injection attacks or unsafe data handling.
- Detect any authentication or authorization oversights (even if not implemented).
- Review the code for violations of secure coding practices.
- Provide suggestions for securely handling user data and system interactions.

---

ðŸ”¹ **As a Performance Specialist:**
- Identify potential performance bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
- Evaluate space and time complexity (e.g., loops, memory usage).
- Suggest improvements for processing large datasets efficiently.
- Recommend optimizations and patterns that can improve scalability.

---

For **each role**, please provide:
- Specific observations about the implementation.
- Concrete, actionable recommendations for improvement.
- Examples or code snippets to illustrate the improvements.
- Assessment of the potential risk or impact level (Low, Medium, High).

Here is the code to analyze:
```python
def process_user_data(data):
    users = []
    
    for i in range(len(data)):
        user = {
            "id": data[i]["id"],
            "name": data[i]["name"],
            "email": data[i]["email"],
            "active": True if data[i]["status"] == "active" else False
        }
        users.append(user)
    
    print("Processed " + str(len(users)) + " users")
    
    return users

def save_to_database(users):
    # TODO: Implement database connection
    success = True
    return success
