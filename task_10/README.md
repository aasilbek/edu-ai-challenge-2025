# Product Search Tool

A console-based product search tool that uses natural language processing and OpenAI's function calling to find products based on user preferences.

## Features

- Natural language input for product search
- Filtering by category, price, rating, and stock availability
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4.1-mini model for intelligent query understanding
- Structured output format for easy reading

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or copy the task_10 folder to your workspace:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:aasilbek/edu-ai-challenge-2025.git
   cd task_10
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python product_search.py
   ```

2. Enter your search query in natural language. For example:
   - "I need a smartphone under $800 with a great camera"
   - "Show me all electronics with a rating above 4.5"
   - "Find me in-stock fitness equipment under $100"

3. The application will display matching products in a structured format.

4. Type 'quit' to exit the application.

## Example Queries

- "Find me all electronics under $500"
- "Show me books with a rating above 4.5"
- "I need kitchen appliances that are in stock"
- "Find me fitness equipment under $50 with good ratings"

## Notes

- The application uses the `products.json` file as its data source
- Make sure your OpenAI API key is properly set in the `.env` file
- The application uses OpenAI's function calling mechanism to interpret natural language queries
- **Never commit your `.env` file or API key to version control**
